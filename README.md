# Docker-based Netbeans
* NetBeans v8.2 in a Docker container
* Java 8 (1.8.0_141) JDK + Maven 3.5.0 + Python 3.5.2 + X11 (display GUI)

## Requirements
* Docker 1.13.1+ 
* An X11 socket

## Build
```
./build.sh
```

## Run
```
./run.sh
```

## Configuration
The docker container will assume there is a default /workspace folder. Be default, './run.sh', will use/create the local folder, "$HOME/data_docker/netbeans" to map into the docker's internal "/workspace" folder.

The above approach will ensure all your projects created in the container's "/workspace" folder is "persistent" in your local folder, i.e., "$HOME/data_docker/netbeans/workspace"

## Making plugins persist between sessions

NetBeans plugins are kept on `$HOME/.netbeans` inside the container, so if you
want to keep them around after you close it, you'll need to share it with your
host.

For example:

```sh
docker run -ti --rm \
           -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
           -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
           -v `pwd`/.netbeans:/home/developer/.netbeans \
           -v `pwd`:/home/developer/workspace \
           openkbs/netbeans
```

## Help! I started the container but I don't see the NetBeans screen

You might have an issue with the X11 socket permissions since the default user
used by the base image has an user and group ids set to `1000`, two options:
* Create your own base image with the appropriate ids or 
* Or, at the host, run
```
`xhost +` 
```
try again.
